# Pantry

Pantry is a self-hosted, open-source web app for managing your pantry. Other available
options didn't suit my personal needs (either too complicated, didn't work well on
smaller screens, or some other reasons), so I decided to write my own.

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
1. Track what products you have in stock
2. Track when things expire
3. To have a modern UI that works well on many screen sizes
  - Phones
  - Touchscreen kiosks (more on that later)
  - Tablets
  - Desktop
3. and to make it easy for the user to do all of this!

... More to come ...
